## Project Summary
Our project involves creating an interface that will allow our users, patients, to interact with various medical and personal information related to them. Such an interface will include ways to view, schedule, reschedule, and cancel appointments; view and request a fill up on prescribed prescriptions; view and track personal medical statistics such as BMI, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate, and body temperature; and finally, view financial information such as charges that are due for various procedures and appointments that have been serviced or need to be serviced as well as insurance information. This will allow patients to be in control of their health, ensuring that they have all the resources and details that can help them improve their health.
